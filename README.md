### My client
I have had several meetings with a student Cinematographer and Freelancer whose
goal is to increase his recognition in the film and photography industry whilst
also increasing his work and job opportunities. 

### The Idea
I have discussed with my client and we agree that having an online presence
where he can showcase his work and skills will be a good way to increase his
renown and allow his potential clients to contact him.

## Strategy

- As a potential employer
I would like to know about the cinematographer
So that I know who Iâ€™m going to be hiring.

## Technologies Used
**_HTML_** and **_CSS_** were the main languages used to create the base structure and style of the website.

 **<a target="_blank" href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>** - Used for styling the layout of my website including the dropdown menu.

**<a target="_blank" href="http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/3/">Fancybox</a>** - Used on the Photography and Commercial page to create the light box photo gallery.

**<a target="_blank" href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google Fonts</a>** - Used to change the text font style used through out the website. 

**<a target="_blank" href="https://fontawesome.com/">Font Awesome</a>** - Used to style the social buttons to the recognisable icons. 

**<a target="_blank" href="https://www.javascript.com/">JavaScript</a>** - Used to make the website interactive and responsive, allowing me to create the pop up footer that appears on small devices.

**<a target="_blank" href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>** - Used in junction with bootstrap to enable the functionality of the dropdown menu as well as helping to manipulate the DOM.

## Testing
- I validated the HTML and CSS using <a target="_blank" href="https://validator.w3.org/">W3C</a> Markup Validation Service.  
Using this I discoverd I had a couple of semantic issues.  
I had unnecessary divs, and list items nested in anchor tags.  
These issues didn't effect the website however it was an easy fix.

- I used Google Chrome Developer tools through out the developmet of the website and used it to cheack the responsiveness and that all the media queries are working as expected.  
Using the DevTools I was able to get an idea of how my website would look on smaller devices such as the Pixel 2, Galaxy S5, iPhone 6/7/8+ iPad and the iPad Pro.

- I also tested the website on differnt web-browsers to make sure that it works as expected accross a range of web-browsers which include:  
Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Firefox, Opera and Safari on an iPhone 7+.

iii. Click on a photo a verify that the photo gallery opens 
iv. Use left and right arrow buttons to navigate through clients work.

vi. Click on a video and verify that it starts to play. 

2. I want to be able to contact the cinematographer.  
i. Open website  
ii. Go to "Contact" page  
iii. Try to submit the form without a name and verify a notification appears asking to fill in required field  
iv. Try to submit the form without a correct email address and verify that an error message appears asking for a correct email  
v. Submit form with all the required fields filled out correctly.

3. I would like to know about the cinematographer.

4. I would like links to the cinematographers social pages.  
i. Open website  
ii. Click on the social icons at the bottom of the page and verify the links are working and opens in a new tab.

- NavBar  
  - Click each navigation link to verify that they are working correctly on all pages and directs the user to the indended page  
  - Click on the logo on each page and verify that it sends the user back to the landing page.  
  - On smaller devices click on the burger button and verify the drop down menu appears and the links work.  
  - Verify the nav link for the current page is in bold indicating the user what page they are on.

- Footer  
  - Click on the contact me button and verify that it directs the user to the "Contact" page  
  - On smaller devices click on the "MySocial" tab and verify the social links appear
  - Click on the social links and verify that they open a new tab. 
  (I have purposly left the links blank as my client has asked)

- **Bugs**  
Even though the website works fine on a multiple of different screen sizes and devices I have noticed that when changing the screen width from <992px to >991 the footer menu changes the layout and fails to work when changing the screen width back to >992. This can be sloved by refreshing the webpage however it does not provide a good UX. I tried fixing it by adding an eventListener into my script.js file that would reload the page once it had detected a screen width change. This fixed one problem but caused another so I later commented out that code. I plan to find a fix for this soon.

# First Milestone Project

### Deployment
The website is being hosted by GitHub Pages you can check it out by clicking <a target="_blank" href="https://garyfinlayson.github.io/First-Milestone-Project/">Here!</a>

### My client
I have had several meetings with a student Cinematographer and Freelancer whose
goal is to increase his recognition in the film and photography industry whilst
also increasing his work and job opportunities. 

### The Idea
I have discussed with my client and we agree that having an online presence
where he can showcase his work and skills will be a good way to increase his
renown and allow his potential clients to contact him.

## Strategy
### Who are the Target audience?

- As a potential employer
I would like to know about the cinematographer
So that I know who Iâ€™m going to be hiring.
